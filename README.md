# Language-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning
A supervised machine learning model is trained using a Kaggle dataset with text samples in 20 languages. TF-IDF vectorization is used to convert text into features, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier predicts the language of user-inputted text.
